3. I wish to become good at programming .
I was accompanied by computers from young age and I'm glad I have this opportunity to learn not to only use them as the user,
but to master them as the programmer. I have plenty of time to do that and I hope I will learn a lot from you .
4. Basic CSS, basic HTML, basci Javascript, use of jQuery, use of Bootstrap, basic Git .
5. You can find examples of code on my [codepen](https://codepen.io/Ildorado/ ) .
6. This is my [codepen](https://codepen.io/Ildorado/ ) . It contains my projects for Freecodecamp course .
Althought I improved a lot since I did(A lot of code is not semantically correct, but reading Clean Code ,
various articles and course in codeacademy made me better by much) .

8. I improved my English by much by reading in English and Listening to English native speakers.
For 3-4 years I watch Shows, listen to podcasts, read books, surf the internet predominantly in English(Don't remember even when I did that in Russian last time) .
But I have some problems with grammar(That's why I got only B-2 on EPAM English test) and lack of live communication in English .
